# PortugueseEmotionRecognitionWeakSupervision
A Weak Supervised Dataset of Fine-Grained Emotions in Portuguese including 28 categories

Affective Computing is the study of how computers can recognize, interpret and simulate human affects. Sentiment Analysis is a common task in NLP related to this topic, but it focuses only on emotion valence (positive, negative, neutral). An emerging approach in NLP is Emotion Recognition, which relies on fined-grained classification. This research describes an approach to create a lexical-based weak supervised corpus for fine-grained emotion in Portuguese. We evaluate our dataset by fine-tuning a transformer-based language model (BERT) and validating it on a Golden Standard annotated validation set. Our results (F1-score= .64) suggest lexical-based weak supervision as an appropriate strategy for initial work in low resources environment.

This dataset is described in the paper "A Weak Supervised Dataset of Fine-Grained Emotions in Portuguese".
Please note that in respect of twitter's terms of use, we only make available the Tweet_ID associated with each annotated category.
To collect the sentence text, the researcher must collect it directly from the Twitter API using the Tweet ID list.
